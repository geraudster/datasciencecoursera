* `Ozone`: Mean ozone in parts per billion from 1300 to 1500 hours at Roosevelt Island
* `Solar.R`: Solar radiation in Langleys in the frequency band 4000–7700 Angstroms from 0800 to 1200 hours at Central Park
* `Wind`: Average wind speed in miles per hour at 0700 and 1000 hours at LaGuardia Airport

For the purpose of this application, we use log(Ozone) instead of Ozone, to ensure the values are normally distributed.
